Procurement management is a strategic approach to acquiring goods or services from preferred vendors within your defined budget, on or before a specific deadline.

Your goal is to balance supply and demand, so you maintain a minimum inventory level to meet your store's demand.

### Article
In this [Article](https://www.samirsaci.com/procurement-process-optimization-with-python/), we will present a simple methodology using Non-Linear Programming to design an optimal inventory replenishment strategy for a mid-size retail store, considering
- Transportation Costs from the Supplier Warehouse to the Store Reserve ($/Carton)
- Costs to finance your inventory (% of inventory value in $)
- Reserve (Store’s Warehouse) Rental Costs for storage ($/Carton)

### Problem Statement
As a Store Manager at a mid-sized retail location, you are responsible for setting replenishment quantities in the ERP.

For each SKU, when the inventory level falls below a defined threshold, your ERP system automatically issues a Purchase Order (PO) to your supplier.

You need to balance stock capacity, transportation costs, and inventory costs to determine the right quantity for your PO.

### Question
Which Quantity per replenishment (Qi) should you set in the ERP to minimise total costs?

## Code
In this repository, you will find all the code used to explain the concepts presented in the article.
